            When you make an Google Play Billing request with this product ID, Google Play responds as though you successfully purchased an item.
            The response includes a JSON string, which contains fake purchase information (for example, a fake order ID).

            <h3>Developer-Test-Abbruch</h3>
            <p>
                When you make an Google Play Billing request with this product ID Google Play responds as though the purchase was canceled.
                This can occur when an error is encountered in the order process, such as an invalid credit card,
                or when you cancel a user's order before it is charged.
